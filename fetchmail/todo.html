<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fetchmail Bugs and To-Do Items</H1>

<p>I try to respond to urgent bug reports in a timely way.  But fetchmail
is now pretty mature and I have many other projects, so I don't
personally chase obscure or marginal problems.  Help with any of these
will be cheerfully accepted.

<p>Using LMTP alias with a local name that is not a full name fails horribly
(the LMTP port never gets stripped off the name).

<p>The UIDL code seems rather broken.  It's a nasty swamp.  Somebody who
actually uses it should fix it -- every time I try I seem to make
things worse....

<p>POP3 can't presently distinguish a wedged or down server from an
authentication failure.  Possible fix: after issuing a PASS
command. wait 300 (xx) seconds for a "-ERR" or a "+OK" . If nothing
comes back, retry at the next poll event and generate no errors. If we
get an -ERR then log an authentication failure.

<p>SMTP authentication a la RFC 2554 ought to be supported.  The Exim
reference has a 
<a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-3.10/doc/html/spec_33.html#SEC705">
whole chapter on this topic</a>.

<p>It has been reported that multidrop name matching fails when the name
to be matched contains a Latin-1 umlaut.  Dollars to doughnuts this is
some kind of character sign-extension problem.  Trouble is, it's very
likely in the BIND libraries.  Someone should go in with a debugger 
and check this.

<p>In the SSL support, add authentication of Certifying Authority (Is this
a Certifying Authority we recognize?).

<p>Laszlo Vecsey writes: "I believe qmail uses a technique of writing
temporary files to nfs, and then moving them into place to ensure that
they're written. Actually a hardlink is made to the temporary file and
the destination name in a new directory, then the first one is
unlinked.. maybe a combination of this will help with the fetchmail
lock file."

<p>Move everything to using service strings rather that port numbers, so we
can get rid of ENABLE_INET6 everywhere but in SockOpen (this will get
rid of the kluge in rcfile_y.y).

<p>The <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=fetchmail&archive=no">Debian
bug-tracking page for fetchmail</a> lists other bug reports.
