<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fetchmail Feature List</H1>

<H2>Since 5.0:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>ESMTP AUTH (RFC 2554) is supported.

<LI>Has the capability of adding trace information to the Received header to
faciliate mail filtering by mailserver and remote account.

<LI>Fetchmail now has options to handle SSL certificate validation.

<LI>Fetchmail now falls back to delivering via local MDA if it can't
open port 25.

<LI>Support for AUTH=CRAM-MD5 under POP3, a la RFC2195.

<LI>Support for ODMR (On-Demand Mail Relay), RFC 2645 (untested).

<LI>It's now easy to deliver mail to a local LMTP socket.

<LI>The interface option now checks both local and remote interface IPs.

<LI>
The plugin facility has been enhanced; %h and %p options are now
available to pass in the hostname and service port number.

<LI>
Added a dropdelivered option to discard Delivered-To headers. This
addresses a problem with using fetchmail and postfix as a relay inside
a domain; when postfix sees incoming messages with delivered-to
headers looking exactly the same as the ones it adds himself, it
bounces the message.

<LI>
Added --smtpname to set username and domain portion of SMTP "RCPT TO"
command. &gt;fetchmail@mail.julianhaight.com&gt;.

<LI>
Added "from" server's IP address to inserted Received line
&gt;fetchmail@mail.julianhaight.com&lt;.

<LI>
Fetchmail now runs on BeOS, thanks to David Reid &lt;david@jetnet.co.uk&gt;.

<LI>
In IMAP, unseen-message counting and indexing is now done by SEARCH
UNSEEN at the beginning of each poll or re-poll (rather than with
the UNSEEN and RECENT responses and FLAGS queries on individual
messages). This significantly cuts down on traffic to and from the
server, and gives more reliable results.

<LI>
The aka option now matches hostname suffixes, so (for example) saying
`aka netaxs.com' will match not just netaxs.com but also (say)
pop3.netaxs.com and mail.netaxs.com.

<LI>
Fetchmail can optionally use the RFC 2177 IDLE extension on an IMAP 
server that supports it.

<LI>
Fetchmail now recognizes the RFC 2449 extended responses [IN-USE] and
[LOGIN-DELAY].

<LI>
Fetchmail running in daemon mode now restarts itself quietly when the
rc file is touched.

<LI>Following recent court decisions and changes in U.S. federal
regulatory policy, hooks for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are now part
of the main fetchmail distribution.  The distribution still contains
no actual cryptographic code.

<LI>NTLM support under IMAP, so fetchmail can query Microsoft Exchange servers.

<LI>Expunge option can now be used to break POP3 retrieval into subsessions. 

<LI>Support for AUTH=CRAM-MD5 under IMAP, a la RFC2195.
</UL>

<H2>Since 4.0:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The interface and monitor options now work with freeBSD.

<LI> Fetchmail now sends RFC1894-conformant bouncemail on SMTP and LMTP errors.

<LI> Full support for LMTP according to RFC2033.

<LI> True multi-language support using GNU gettext.

<LI> Support for use of HESIOD with Kerberos.

<LI> The --bsmtp option supports recording fetched mail as a BSMTP batch.

<LI> The --limit option can now be used in daemon mode, with oversized-message
notifications being mailed to the calling user.

<LI> 
Configurable support for the <a
href="http://www.demon.net/info/helpdesk/demon_products/mail/sdps-tech.shtml">SDPS
extensions</a> in <a href="http://www.demon.net/">www.demon.net</a>'s
POP3 service.

<LI> There is now an interactive GUI fetchmail configurator, fetchmailconf.

<LI> Code is 64-bit clean and Y2K-safe.

<LI> Automatically decodes armored 7-bit MIME into 8 bits (this can be
suppressed).

<LI> You can specify which SMTP error is recognized as a spam block.

<LI> Support for Kerberos V authentication.

<LI> Support for IMAP-OTP authentication using Craig Metz's patches 
     for UW IMAP.

<LI> Support for IPv6 (using glibc or Craig Metz's inet6-apps library).

<Li> Support for IPSEC (using Craig Metz's inet6-apps library).

<LI> Support for IMAP with RFC1731-conformant GSSAPI authentication.

<LI> Fixed and verified support for Cyrus IMAP server, M$ Exchange,
     and Post Office/NT.

<LI> Support for responding with a one-time password when a POP3 server
     issues an RFC1938-conforming OTP challenge.

<LI> Support for Compuserve's RPA authentication protocol for POP3
     (not compiled in by default, but configurable).
</UL>

<H2>Since 3.0:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Support for IMAP RFC 1731 authentication with Kerberos v4. 

<LI> Support for multiple-folder retrieval in a single session 
     under IMAP. 

<LI> Following SMTP 571 response to a From line, fetchmail no longer 
     downloads the bodies of spam messages. 

<LI> Support for a `hunt list' of SMTP hosts. 

<LI> Support for ESMTP 8BITMIME and SIZE options. 

<LI> Support for ESMTP ETRN command. 

<LI> The stripcr & forcecr options to explicitly control carriage-return 
     stripping and LF-&gt;CRLF mapping before mail forwarding. 
</UL>

<H2>Since 2.0:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Support for secure use with ssh. 

<LI> Mailserver passwords can be parsed out of your .netrc file. 

<LI> When forwarding mail via SMTP, fetchmail respects the 571 
     "spam filter" response and discards any mail that triggers it. 

<LI> Transaction and error logging may optionally be done via syslog. 

<LI> (Linux only) Security option to permit fetchmail to poll a host  
     only when a point-to-point link to a particular IP address is
     up. 

<LI> RPOP support (restored; had been removed in 1.8). 
</UL>

<H2>2.0 and earlier versions:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Support POP2, APOP, RPOP, IMAP2, IMAP2bis, IMAP3, IMAP4, IMAP4rev1. .

<LI> Support for Kerberos V4 user authentication (either MIT or Cygnus). 

<LI> Host is auto-probed for a working server if no protocol is
     specified for the connection.  Thus you don't need to know
     what servers are running on your mail host in advance; the
     verbose option will tell you which one succeeds. 

<LI> Delivery via SMTP to the client machine's port 25.  This
     means the retrieved mail automatically goes to the system
     default MDA as if it were normal sender-initiated SMTP mail. 

<LI> Configurable timeout to detect if server connection is dropped. 

<LI> Support for retrieving and forwarding from multi-drop mailboxes 
     that is guaranteed not to cause mail loops. 

<LI> Large user community -- fetchmail has a large user base (the
     author's beta list includes well over two hundred people).  This 
     means feedback is rapid, bugs get found and fixed rapidly. 

<LI> Carefully written, comprehensive and up-to-date man page describing
     not only modes of operation but also how to diagnose the most
     common kinds of problems and what to do about deficient servers.

<LI> Rugged, simple, and well-tested code -- the author relies on it
     every day and it has never lost mail, not even in experimental
     versions.  (In the project's entire history there has only been
     one recorded instance of lost mail, and that was due to a quirk
     in some Microsoft code.)

<LI> Strict conformance to relevant RFCs and good debugging options.
     You could use fetchmail to test and debug server implementatations.

<LI> For anybody who cares, fetchmail is Y2K safe.
</UL>

<H2>Features in common with other remote-mail retrieval programs:</H2>

The other programs I have checked include fetchpop1.9, PopTart-0.9.3,
get-mail, gwpop, pimp-1.0, pop-perl5-1.2, popc, popmail-1.6 and upop.

<UL>
<LI> Support for POP3.

<LI> Easy control via command line or free-format run control file.

<LI> Daemon mode -- fetchmail can be run in background to poll 
     one or more hosts at a specified interval.

<LI> From:, To:, Cc:, and Reply-To: headers are rewritten so that 
     usernames relative to the fetchmail host become fully-qualified
     Internet addresses.  This enables replies to work correctly.
     (Would be unique to fetchmail if I hadn't added it to fetchpop.)

<LI> Message and header processing are 8-bit clean.
</UL>
