                       Fetchmail Bugs and To-Do Items

   I  try to respond to urgent bug reports in a timely way. But fetchmail
   is  now  pretty  mature  and  I  have  many other projects, so I don't
   personally  chase obscure or marginal problems. Help with any of these
   will be cheerfully accepted.

   Using  LMTP  alias  with  a  local  name that is not a full name fails
   horribly (the LMTP port never gets stripped off the name).

   The  UIDL  code  seems rather broken. It's a nasty swamp. Somebody who
   actually  uses  it  should  fix  it -- every time I try I seem to make
   things worse....

   POP3  can't  presently  distinguish  a  wedged  or down server from an
   authentication  failure.  Possible  fix: after issuing a PASS command.
   wait 300 (xx) seconds for a "-ERR" or a "+OK" . If nothing comes back,
   retry at the next poll event and generate no errors. If we get an -ERR
   then log an authentication failure.

   SMTP  authentication  a  la  RFC  2554 ought to be supported. The Exim
   reference has a whole chapter on this topic.

   It  has been reported that multidrop name matching fails when the name
   to  be matched contains a Latin-1 umlaut. Dollars to doughnuts this is
   some  kind  of character sign-extension problem. Trouble is, it's very
   likely in the BIND libraries. Someone should go in with a debugger and
   check this.

   In  the  SSL  support,  add authentication of Certifying Authority (Is
   this a Certifying Authority we recognize?).

   Laszlo  Vecsey  writes:  "I  believe qmail uses a technique of writing
   temporary files to nfs, and then moving them into place to ensure that
   they're written. Actually a hardlink is made to the temporary file and
   the  destination  name  in  a  new  directory,  then  the first one is
   unlinked..  maybe  a  combination of this will help with the fetchmail
   lock file."

   Move  everything to using service strings rather that port numbers, so
   we  can  get rid of ENABLE_INET6 everywhere but in SockOpen (this will
   get rid of the kluge in rcfile_y.y).

   The Debian bug-tracking page for fetchmail lists other bug reports.
