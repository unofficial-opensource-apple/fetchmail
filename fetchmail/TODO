                        Fetchmail Bugs and To-Do Items

   I  try to respond to urgent bug reports in a timely way. But fetchmail
   is  now  pretty  mature  and  I  have  many other projects, so I don't
   personally  chase obscure or marginal problems. Help with any of these
   will be cheerfully accepted.

   Feature request from "Ralf G. R. Bergs" "When fetchmail downloads mail
   and  Exim+SpamAssassin  detecs  an incoming message as spam, fetchmail
   tries  to  bounce  it.  Unfortunately it uses an incorrect hostname as
   part  of  the  sender  address  (I've  an  internal  LAN  with private
   hostnames,  plus  an  official  IP address and hostname, and fetchmail
   picks  the  internal  name  of  my host.) So I'd like to have a config
   statement  that allows me to explicitly set a senderaddress for bounce
   messages."

   POP3  can't  presently  distinguish  a  wedged  or down server from an
   authentication  failure.  Possible  fix: after issuing a PASS command.
   wait 300 (xx) seconds for a "-ERR" or a "+OK" . If nothing comes back,
   retry at the next poll event and generate no errors. If we get an -ERR
   then log an authentication failure.

   It  has been reported that multidrop name matching fails when the name
   to  be matched contains a Latin-1 umlaut. Dollars to doughnuts this is
   some  kind  of character sign-extension problem. Trouble is, it's very
   likely in the BIND libraries. Someone should go in with a debugger and
   check this.

   In  the  SSL  support,  add authentication of Certifying Authority (Is
   this a Certifying Authority we recognize?).

   Debian   wishlist  item  181157:  ssl  key  learning  for  self-signed
   certificates.

   Laszlo  Vecsey  writes:  "I  believe qmail uses a technique of writing
   temporary files to nfs, and then moving them into place to ensure that
   they're written. Actually a hardlink is made to the temporary file and
   the  destination  name  in  a  new  directory,  then  the first one is
   unlinked..  maybe  a  combination of this will help with the fetchmail
   lock file."

   Move  everything to using service strings rather that port numbers, so
   we  can  get rid of ENABLE_INET6 everywhere but in SockOpen (this will
   get rid of the kluge in rcfile_y.y).

   John  Summerfield  suggests  that  specifying a localname containing @
   ought  to  be  treated  as  an  smtpname  option, with the domain part
   removed for other purposes such as local-address matching.

   Maybe refuse multidrop configuration unless "envelope" is _explicitly_
   configured  (and  tell  the  user  he  needs to configure the envelope
   option)  and  change the envelope default to nil. This would prevent a
   significant class of shoot-self-in-foot problems.

   Given  the  above  change,  perhaps  treat  a delivery as "temporarily
   failed"  (leaving  the  message  on  the  server,  not putting it into
   .fetchids)  when  the  header  listed  in the "envelope" option is not
   found.  (This  is  so  you  don't lose mail if you configure the wrong
   envelope header.)

   The Debian bug-tracking page for fetchmail lists other bug reports.
